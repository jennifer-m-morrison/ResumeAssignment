      <h1>Jennifer Morrison</h1>
      <h2>Web Developer</h2>

      <p>Welcome! My name is Jennifer and I am currently a web developer student at Wake
        Tech Community College in Raleigh, NC. While refining my HTML, CSS, and Javascript
        skills, I am also learning industry best practices to provide clients with
        functional, visually-appealing websites tailored to their individual needs and
        goals.</p>
      <p>What sets me apart is not only my technical proficiency but also my strong
        problem-solving skills and teamwork abilities. I am a dedicated life-long learner
        and am confident that my adaptability and enthusiasm for keeping up with the
        rapidly evolving tech landscape will serve my clients well.</p>
